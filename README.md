Fragmentation refers to the phenomenon in computer systems where the available memory or storage space becomes divided into small, non-contiguous blocks over time due to the allocation and deallocation of resources. Fragmentation can occur in both memory (RAM) and storage (disk) systems. There are two main types of fragmentation:

1. **Memory Fragmentation:**
   - Memory fragmentation occurs in the computer's RAM.
   - Two main types: 
     - **Internal Fragmentation:** This occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks (such as memory pages) and the allocated block is larger than what the process needs. The unused portion of the block is wasted memory.
     - **External Fragmentation:** This occurs when free memory is scattered in small chunks between allocated memory blocks, making it difficult to allocate a large contiguous block for a new process.

2. **Disk Fragmentation:**
   - Disk fragmentation occurs in storage devices like hard drives.
   - Two main types:
     - **File Allocation Fragmentation:** This occurs when files are split into non-contiguous blocks on the storage device. As files are created, modified, and deleted, their contents become scattered, leading to slower read and write operations.
     - **Free Space Fragmentation:** This occurs when free space on the storage device becomes divided into small, non-contiguous chunks, making it challenging to allocate space for new files.

Fragmentation can lead to several issues:

- **Reduced Performance:** In memory systems, fragmentation can lead to inefficient memory usage, slower memory access times, and decreased system performance. In storage systems, it can result in slower read and write operations due to the need to access scattered data blocks.
  
- **Wasted Resources:** Internal fragmentation wastes memory by allocating more space than needed for each process or file.
  
- **Difficulty in Memory/Storage Management:** External fragmentation can make it harder to allocate contiguous blocks of memory or storage space for new processes or files.

To mitigate fragmentation, various techniques are used:

- **Memory Management Techniques:** Memory management strategies like compaction (moving processes to reduce external fragmentation) and dynamic memory allocation algorithms help manage memory fragmentation.

- **Disk Defragmentation:** Disk defragmentation utilities reorganize files and free space on a storage device, reducing file allocation fragmentation and improving storage performance.

In modern computing systems, operating systems and storage management mechanisms work to minimize fragmentation and optimize resource allocation to maintain system performance and efficient resource usage.
